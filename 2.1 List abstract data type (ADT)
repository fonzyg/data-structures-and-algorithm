A List ADT is a data structure that holds ordered data and provides operations to manipulate that data. Key characteristics include:

Ordered storage of elements
Operations like append, remove, search, and print
Abstraction of implementation details from the user
Common operations:

Append: Add an element to the end
Remove: Delete a specific element
Search: Find if an element exists
Print: Display all elements in order
Example:
Let's create a list of integers and perform some operations:

text

list = new List()
Append(list, 7)
Append(list, 9)
Append(list, 5)

Print(list)  // Output: 7, 9, 5

Search(list, 8)  // Result: Not found

Remove(list, 9)
Print(list)  // Output: 7, 5

Append(list, 12)
Print(list)  // Output: 7, 5, 12
This example demonstrates how a List ADT maintains order, allows for element manipulation, and abstracts the underlying implementation from the user. The user doesn't need to know how the list is stored internally (array, linked list, etc.) to use its operations effectively.
